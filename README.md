<h1 align=center>Restaurant Advisor Application</h1>
<lu>
  <li><b>It is important to mention that this application was created for educational purposes.</b></li>
  <li><i>Restaurants information is taken from: <a href=https://www.yelp.com/>yelp</i></a> (as example).</i></li>
  <li><i>We used free icons from: <a href=https://www.flaticon.com>flaticon</a>.</i></li>

<h2 align=center>Subject</h2>
This application is used to browse different types of restaurants in Munich, see their detailed information, reviews and make a reservation. Also, the application is written only in java which was a challange for my team. In addition, it can be modified to cover differen area or scope.

<h2 align=center>Dependencies</h2>
<lu>
  <li>Open JDK 17+</li>
  <li>Spring Framework</li>
  <li>Javafx 17.0.2</li>
  <li>Jsoup 1.51.1</li>
</lu>
<br></br>
<i>Detailed list of dependencies can be found in documentation.</i>

<h2 align=center>Problems</h2>
Some requirements were not met due to time restrictions, but source code can be easily improved. Web scraping in our example is not complicated, because html document contains json inside of it which saved us a lot of time. Actual data extraction can be complex. Reservation implementation is not real, because it requires collaboration with real restaurants, which is unrealistic in case of university project.
